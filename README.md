# CS 341: System Programming

This repository contains the code for the homeworks as listed on https://cs341.cs.illinois.edu/coursebook/index.html.

Was recommended to check out this course, and it looks pretty cool. I'm not affiliated with UIUC.

First time using C as well. I wonder how long it'll take before I segfault. UPDATE: It took until chapter 2 of homework 0, but that's because I got set up to fail.
